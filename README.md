# Learning C and C++
This repository documents my journey of learning C and C++ during my first year. In the first semester, I focused on mastering programming fundamentals through C, while the second semester was dedicated to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++. It includes assignments, projects, and notes that reflect my progress and understanding of these essential programming languages.
